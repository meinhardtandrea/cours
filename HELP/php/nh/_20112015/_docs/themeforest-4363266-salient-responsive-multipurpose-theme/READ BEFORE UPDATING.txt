Salient v5.5 separated Visual Composer into a plugin and it is no longer automatically built in - this means when you activate the theme you'll have to still install the Visual Composer plugin via the admin panel. It is included still with the theme and no purchase is necessary, just head to the "install plugins" link in your admin panel located in the "appearance" section to install & activate. Cheers!
